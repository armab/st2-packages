# Stackstorm CI environment for building OS packages

This whole process of continuous integration bases on docker to provide an easy an configurable way to build, install and test Stackstorm OS packages.

Stackstorm OS packages include a complete pre-built and independent python virtual environments containing a single st2 component. This is that what makes such package independent and it can be easily installed/removed or upgraded separately from other stackstorm OS packages.

CI process consist of three phases:

 - **Package build phase**. Packages are build for a specific platform family.
 - **Package installation phase**. Built packages are transferred on to a remote test node.
 - **Integration tests phase**. Integration suite is run on a special worker node, but checks happen on a remote test node.

The second and the third phases have multi-node support which makes it possible to run build packages phase once. Say it we build packages for debian family systems and then phases *2, 3* can be repeated on different nodes such as ubuntu trusty, debian jessie, debian wheezy etc.

Suite can be run locally using docker-compose or it can be enrolled in a [Drone CI](https://drone.io/) environment to operate in real CI scenarios.

## Metadata and configuration

We can provide several options to configure our suite, let's take a look at `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
ubuntu:
  image: quay.io/dennybaa/droneruby
  working_dir: /root/workdir
  entrypoint: ["/bin/bash", "/root/workdir/.drone/build.sh"]
  environment:
    # Full list of st2 packages configures the default build
    - COMPOSE=1
    - ST2_PACKAGES=st2common st2actions st2api st2auth st2client st2reactor
    - ST2_GITURL=https://github.com/dennybaa/st2.git
    - ST2_GITREV=setuptools_packaging_improvements
    - ST2_TESTMODE=bundle
    - BUILDHOST=buildenvdeb
    - TESTHOSTS=trusty
    - DEBUG=1
  links:
    - buildenvdeb
    - rabbitmq
    - mongodb
    - trusty
  volumes:
    - .:/root/workdir
    - /tmp/st2-packages:/root/packages
```

This is the configuration of ubuntu worker machine which is a ruby one and it's able to run rspec integration tests. These tests use [serverspec](http://serverspec.org) library for testing servers.
For up to date schema details, have a look into the metadata file [docker-compose.yml](docker-compose.yml).

Let's describe a few important configuration variables:

 - **ST2_PACKAGES** - specifies a full list of st2 components which defines what components will be built.
 - **ST2_GITURL** - specifies an URL of upstream stackstorm sources.
 - **ST2_GITREV** - specifies a revision or branch which will be checked out.
 - **ST2_WAITFORSTART** - specifies timeout to wait for st2 services to start.
 - **ST2_TESTMODE** - specifies what integration tests to perform there're two options are available: **bundle** and **components** (*the former is the default*). In case full package list has been built and the test mode is bundle, integration testing will be invoke for **st2bundle** package.
 - **BUILDHOST** - specifies a node where packages build process happens.
 - **TESTHOSTS** - specifies a list of nodes which the integration tests will be performed upon.

## Running suite with docker compose

Issue the command bellow and the whole suite will be run, after it finishes you can find packages in your `/tmp/st2-packages` directory.
```
docker-compose run ubuntu
```
